# Question 1: Explain the difference between the = operator and the == operator in Python.
# = assigns a value to a variable.
# == is for comparing two values

num = 5 # assigning a value 5 to variable num

a = 2
b = 2
print(a == b) # here we are comparing two values which is a and b, the result will be in boolean

# Question 2: What does the ** operator do in Python, and how is it used?
# It is actually a power of the value which we used in mathematics which named as Exponentiation

c = 2
d = 5
print(c ** d) # the calculation will be 2 to the power of 5, which is 2*2*2*2*2 = 32

# Question 3: What does the ^ operator do in Python, and in what context is it commonly used
# ^ is Bitwise XOR (exclusive OR) operator, a ^ b
e = 10  # Binary: 1010
f = 6   # Binary: 0110
g = e ^ f
print("Result of bitwise XOR between", e, "and", f, "is:", g)
